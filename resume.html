            I'm currently a Product Engineer at <a href="https://asana.com/?noredirect">Asana</a>. 
            I've been a part of the Customer Scaling team here since June 2019.<br>

                <strong>2022</strong><br>
                🛠 WIP, the year's just starting!<br>
                <strong>2021</strong><br>
                I did some more stuff…<br>
                <strong>2020</strong><br>
                I received ownership of the migrator tool, and surrounding framework, that we built in 2019.<br>
                <strong>2019</strong><br>
                The first few months were onboarding – went through a real fun bootcamp, and shipped my first couple of bugfixes and first small features. 
                One small feature represented our second use case (and first guinea pig experience) for a new engineering platform my team maintained,
                which allowed product features to leverage aggregate data from our data science and business systems. Along the way, I made contributions
                to the developer experience for using this system, including creating scripts to test this system in our dev environments.<br>
                From there, I joined our fledgeling work on our domain migrator project. This tool, to allow customers to "merge" two Asana instances together,
                understood our object model and was able to copy it from one instance to another, preserving links between objects and discarding broken objects.
                This functionality needed to be supported for all future objects as well, so we emphasized a developer experience that was straightforward for
                most objects (which could be supported with a one-line change!), but extensible enough for the myriad ways our product evolves.

            My last adventure was studying <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/">Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://illinois.edu">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>, 
            from August 2015 through May 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was a Software Engineering Intern at Microsoft in the summer of 2018, where I worked on the 
            <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/automation/">Azure Automation</a> Portal team.<br>
            <small class="subtitle">I worked to get a one-click import of examples of Automations in the documentation into customers' Azure environments,
                to get our users up and running in no time.</small>
        </p>
        <p>
            I was also a TA for the landmark <a href="https://cs498vr.cs.illinois.edu">Virtual Reality course at UIUC</a> from January 2017 until May 2019.<br>
            <small class="subtitle">
                I wrote new assignments and helped create exams, mentored small teams of students to create some awesome final projects,
                and enabled the development of cross-departmental research projects in the class.

            I also interned at <a href="https://ebay.com">eBay</a>, where I worked on the Infrastructure Monitoring team from May through August 2017.<br>
            <small class="subtitle">
                I built a monitoring application to collect aggregate metrics across several infrastructure services running atop Kubernetes,
                and used this data to generate a health score that we could then predictively alert on.
