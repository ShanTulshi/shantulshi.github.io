        <sub class="aka">(also known as Shan Tulshi)</sub>
        <p>
            I'm currently a Product Engineer at <a href="https://asana.com/?noredirect">Asana</a>. 
            I've been working here since June 2019, on the Customer Scaling team.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before this, I studied <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/">Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://illinois.edu">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>, 
            from August 2015 through May 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was a Software Engineering Intern at Microsoft in the summer of 2018, where I worked on the 
            <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/automation/">Azure Automation</a> Portal team.<br>
            <small class="subtitle">I worked to get a one-click import of examples of Automations in the documentation into customers' Azure environments,
                to get our users up and running in no time.</small>
        </p>
        <p>
            I was also a TA for the landmark <a href="https://cs498vr.cs.illinois.edu">Virtual Reality course at UIUC</a> from January 2017 until May 2019.<br>
            <small class="subtitle">
                I wrote new assignments and helped create exams, mentored small teams of students to create some awesome final projects,
                and enabled the development of cross-departmental research projects in the class.

            I also interned at eBay, where I worked on the Infrastructure Monitoring team from May through August 2017.<br>
            <small class="subtitle">
                I built a monitoring application to collect aggregate metrics across several infrastructure services running atop Kubernetes,
                and used this data to generate a health score that we could then predictively alert on.
